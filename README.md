# Decentralized_MessagePassing
An Ethereum based SmartContract based on Solidity language which transfer message to node in a decentralized manner.
Go through the below steps to checkout deployed smart contract.

# Working of Project
I have already deployed a smart contract over Goreli Testnet, and the details of deployed contract is given below:

ðŸ“ŒDeployed Contract Address: 0x36f56750c9f7759a201cF22de36Eb17408C3aDa0
ðŸ”—Remix_Ethereum_link: https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.17+commit.8df45f5f.js

ðŸ“ŒClick on the above link and deploy using the given Deployed contract address, and be the part of Decentralized Message Passing network that I have deployed to test.

ðŸ“ŒYou can check the transaction details of the above smart contract in Etherscan.io

ðŸ“ŒI have created a oneClick dApp to give the smart contract a frontend look and make it easy for everyone to access and understand.

# Deploy your own smart contract 
Method 1:\
To deploy your own Message Passing smart contract.\
  a) Downalod the given source code in your machine.\
  b) Copy solidity code from the Inbox.sol file. \
  c) Open Remix-Ethereum IDE on machine/chrome. \
  d) Erase and paste copied code in Ballot.sol file. \
  e) Deploy using Integrated Web - Goreli Network Metamask \
  f) Hurrrraahhhh !!! Your contract is deployed.\
 
 Method 2:\
 If you want to deploy it from terminal, go through these arguments step by step....\
   a) npm init -y\
   b) npm install solc@0.8.9 web3 mocha ganache-cli @truffle/hdwallet-provider\
   c) npm run test\
   d) node deploy.js \
   e) Hurrrraahhhh !!! Your contract is deployed & now use the address in Remix Ethereum IDE to do transactions.\

 Have fun.....ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰
